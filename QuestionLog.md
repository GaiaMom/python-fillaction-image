1. two objects are similar, very similar. But textures are different. UV coordinates are different, too. How can i match two textures so that two models seem like similar?

2. Blender's UV Project Modifier

3. how to scale object twice

4. how to move camera in the front of object

5. place camera in front of source texture object so that it can project to target object front

6. uv textures are different, but object meshes are similar. very similar objects. how to make target object has texture of the other object so that two objects looks same? Blender app features and script please

7. how to scale target object to have the same capacitor as source object

8. how to move camera

9. I'd like to change texture image of target as the source target's. Then move uv islands specifically coordinates of target to the source corresponding positions of uv

10.unwrap uv of target and make new uv islands as the source's

11. how can i match copied uv coordinates from the source object to the target object vertices automatically? Remember, two objects are very similar, including size and position, etc

12. project front and back uv texture of source object to different places. So texture image should be doubled in width

13. how to make 3d model from bunch of 2d photos, left, right, front, back, top, bottom?

14. automation using script

15. explain about uv project modifier

16. Tow objects are very similar and located in the sample place. I wanna transform one object's faces to the other one's. 

17. how to move vertices world coordinates to the other object's vertices using procrustes method

18. how to generate smart texture and uv maps with orthogonal images(left, right, front, back, top, bottom) and object model

19. How can we find out how many main colors the picture has using python and ml method?
